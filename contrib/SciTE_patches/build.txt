 ~ How to apply the patches to vanilla SciTes Sources ~

-- Download the sources. For SciTE 3.67 you would choose:
[ https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/scite/ci/rel-3-6-7/tree/ ]

-- Extract that archive to a local folder.
-- Rename your downloaded sources to [scintilla-scite]. 
-- open a shell window and do
    
 patch -p0 < 1.scite.367_portable.diff
 patch -p0 < 2.scite_367_user.toolbar.diff
 (...)

-- If your jobs gone well you should see lines like:

 $ patch -p0 <3.scite_364_cleanOptionsMenue.diff
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTE.h
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTEBase.cxx
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTEBase.h
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTEIO.cxx
 (...)

    SciTEs binaries can bee statically (un)linked to libgcc (size. +-1M)
    just append the flag -static to LDFLAGS within the makefile.
