 ~ How to apply the patches to vanilla SciTes Sources ~

-- Download the sources. For SciTE 3.7.0 you would choose:
[ https://sourceforge.net/p/scintilla/scite/ci/rel-3-7-0/tree/ ]

-- Extract that archive to a local folder.
-- Rename your downloaded sources to [scintilla-scite]. 
-- open a shell window and do
    
 patch -p0 < 1.env.userhome.diff
 patch -p0 < 2.transparency.diff
 (...)

-- If your jobs gone well you should see lines like:

 $ patch -p0 <6.cleanOptionsMenue.diff
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTE.h
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTEBase.cxx
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTEBase.h
 patching file scintilla-scite/src/SciTEIO.cxx
 (...)
 
 -- Now you should be set --
 
 ~ Notes on executables Filesize ~

    If your needs require you to - 
    Scintilla.dll can be easily runtime compressed.
    see [ http://upx.sourceforge.net/ ]

    SciTEs binaries can bee statically (un)linked to libgcc (size. +-1M)
    just modify the flag -static to LDFLAGS within the makefile.
